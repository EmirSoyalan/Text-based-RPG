# Text-based-RPG
A simple game

# How to play
Simply just follow the instructions in game. Only thing you have to do is typing numbers (other characters might break the game). There is a 'help' section in game which i hope is enough for users to understand. 

# About
This is a project i made for practicing, improving my abilites and comprehending new things i learned in C++. I tried to keep it as simple as possible for both users and developers and follow common rules. I focused on shortening it for a whole day, but still there are 1600+ lines (was 2000~)
